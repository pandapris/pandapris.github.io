				<p>General pest control include spraying, fogging, baiting, and trapping. 
					Treatment for general pest control covers pest like cockroaches, ants, 
					flies, mosquitoes, fleas, bedbug, rodents, etc. The chemicals used for a 
					general pest control spray are totally safe for humans and pets that shall 
					be those approved by Public Health insecticides as approved by the 
					Pesticides Board of Malaysia.
				<br><br>
				During spraying and fogging, it is recommended that any pet food and water 
				bowls are removed prior to treatment and cleaned after treatment. Food and 
				water must also be covered. Fish and reptile pets must also be remove before 
				spraying and fogging because the chemical may harm them.</p>

			<div class="content-subbox">
				<p>Termite baiting is to place a food source that contains toxicant. Foraging 
					termites that find the baits will consume and share the food containing 
					the toxicant with its nest mates including the Queen and the King through 
					a process called trophallaxis. Elimination process may require 
					approximately 2 to 12 weeks depending on the size of the colony, typically 
					6 to 8 weeks. There will be two types of baiting system that we use which 
					are In-Ground Baiting System which for preventing future invading colony 
					from infesting the premises and Above Ground Baiting System which is to 
					eliminate current termite infestation in the premises.</p>

			<h2 class="right-heading">Pre- & Post-Construction Anti 
			Termites</h2>
			<div class="content-subbox">
				<p>Pre-Construction Anti termite treatment is normally carried out before 
					construction <!--of homes, schools, buildings etc--> and Post-Construction 
					Anti Termite Treatment is after construction.
					<br><br>
					It is a process where we treat the soil for termite control. Subterranean 
					Termite can cause great losses to the interest of man especially in houses 
					and buildings in urban areas. They also affect crops, habitation or 
					utilities such as wooden poles. There have even been reports of termites 
					damaging plastic or lead sheathings of underground cables.
					<br><br>
					We spray or inject termiticide to different stages of construction for pre 
					constructed buildings and drill holes surrounding the buildings for 
					post constructed. After treatment is carried out a service warranty of 5, 
					3, or 2 years was awarded to the client. Nowadays all government newly 
					constructed projects have a stringent requirement to apply 
					pre-construction anti termite treatment for its buildings.</p>

				<p>Fumigation is the most effective way to force pests out from their

					hazardous residues. Fumigation will be handled by our licensed fumigator 
					that is fully trained due to the extremely hazardous gases. The application 
					of fumigants is limited to areas, spaces, items, or commodities that
